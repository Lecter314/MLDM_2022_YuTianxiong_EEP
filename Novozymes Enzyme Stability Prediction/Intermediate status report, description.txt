what has been done:
1. intro
2. background of the contest
3. data preprocessing
4. feature engineering
5. statistical analysis
6. model construction (elementary)
7. fit, predict and submit
8. discussion

what should be done:
1. adding more features from external dataset
improvements
2. using methods like PCA rather than drop() for high corrs
3. examine the model more precisely (based on recent lectures)
4. prepare for project defense

p.s. sorry for the imperfect for...everything, this topic is really frontier but interesting, and actually I have no background in biology. I'll try by best, best regards
